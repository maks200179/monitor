# Simple bash script to collect metrics from dockers and host.
The script allow to post collected data into Elasticsearchfter and build visualisation with kibana. 
Just run the docker_compose from my github account to build Elasticsearch ENV.
Add a Linux service with systemd to start the monitor script at startup.
